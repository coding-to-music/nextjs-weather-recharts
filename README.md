## Project History

Weathernaut is the _third_ iteration of a weather app that I made back in March 2020.

> **NOTE**
> In this first section, I'll be discussing the two iterations before Weathernaut, so if you're looking for Weathernaut-specific information, use the table of contents above to get where ever you want to be.

### Iteration 1 redux-weather

###### [LIVE DEMO](https://redux-weather.now.sh/) | [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/stevendelro/redux-weather)

When the pandemic hit America, I decided to hit the keyboard. It had been a few months since I even attempted to code anything, so I was pretty rusty. The first order of business was to make an app that grabs data from an external API. So of course, a weather app fit the bill perfectly.

This single function was the crux of that project. It did two things:

```
// User types in anything and fires off a call to the MapBox API to
// retrieves a best match place name and proper coordinates.
axios
  .get(mapBoxUrl)
  .then(async geocodeData => {
    const long = geocodeData.data.features[0].center[0]
    const lat = geocodeData.data.features[0].center[1]
    const place = geocodeData.data.features[0].place_name

    // Then, those coordinates are sent to the Dark Sky API to retrieve
    // weather data
    await axios
      .get(`${proxy}${darkSkiesUrl}${lat},${long}?exclude=flags`)
      .then(request => {
        const weatherData = request.data
        dispatch(displayedPlace(place))
        dispatch(fetchWeatherSuccess(weatherData))
      })
      .catch(error => console.log('Error making darksky call: ', error))
  })
  .catch(error => console.log('Error making geocode call: ', error))
```

Once I got the data coming in, I incorporated redux in order to manage app state.

I've made apps in the past with redux once before, so this time it wasn't too difficult. All the stateful components in this app were still class based, so there wasn't anything really groundbreaking. I was still really proud of it though.

It had been a long time since I made anything, so I was pretty stoked.

I even made a gif:

### Iteration 2 Umbrellapp

###### [LIVE DEMO](https://umbrellapp.now.sh/) | [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/stevendelro/react-weather-dashboard)

Sweet. So I got all caught up with my old React skills. The next order of business was to wrap my head around React Hooks.

#### Thought Process

Initially, I thought that I should make a completely different type of app.

I mean, I was so tired of looking at the same code. But, I restrained myself. I needed to make things easier for me, not more difficult--regardless if the difficult route would ultimately bear more fruits of knowledge. The goal right now wasn't knowledge accumulation. I need to keep myself focused on the very specific goal of _producing_ finished work.

So, at a bare minimum, what could take this weather app to the next level?

- The app looks horrible. I definitely need to implement some kind of solution to address the looks.
- Doing a complete rewrite with React Hooks would be much easier now, since the majority of the logic was already figured out.
- There was _a ton_ of unused data leftover that I havent used. I should defnitely do something with that data.

With that in mind, I did some research. I read blogs, I looked through subreddits, I even looked at the projects that some of my favorite Udemy instructors were working on or had recently produced in their tutorials. I decided that I really liked the Material UI documentation. Some of it was over my head, but I could figure it out.

After spending some time looking in-depth at their documentation, I came across their boilerplate templates and something about the dashboard example popped out at me. I thought that the best way to use the unused data would be to make it visual. And just like that: I was going to remake the project as a Material UI dashboard, where the main visual components would be charts made with the Recharts charting library.

For a little extra kick, I decided to implement the browser's Geolocation API in order to get the users permission to automatically fetch weather data based on their location. That came with a slew of unforeseen issues, from handling user denial, to understanding how to get the Geolocation API to play nicely with promises and asynchronous data fetches.

Little did I know how much I would be customizing and understanding the Material-UI ecosystem. Seeing how they implement their own components really made an impact on how I approached writting my code.

What resulted from that was, Umbrellapp:

### Iteration 3 Weathernaut

###### [LIVE DEMO](https://weathernaut.now.sh/) | [SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/stevendelro/Weathernaut)

Umbrellapp was so rewarding to create and finish. It, by far, was the most professional looking thing I've ever created. But, we need to go deeper.

Following the same thought process that led me to creating Umbrellapp, how could I incrementally add to this project? How can I build on top of what I've already made, in order to produce something exponentially better than the previous project?

#### Thought Process

With a newfound sense of confidence, I was comfortable with using stateful functional components with React hooks. And, I felt comfortable using Material UI as my current styling library of choice.

What else can I do to take this just a little further? How can I incrementally build on top of what I just made, in order to make something that's much better than the original project?

While building these projects, I would reference certain Udemy tutorials to help get me through some sticking points. My original plan after Umbrellapp was to learn and understand all the hype around Gatsby. Static sites were impressively fast, so I wanted in on that goodness. But, while coding along with Reed Barger on Udemy, I was introduced to NextJS.

NextJS had just released 9.3 where they offered next-gen static site generation support, along side it's ability to provide server side rendering. Plus, the Vercel platform (formally Zeit) had the best developer experience I've had thus far. Sure, I'm a budding developer and don't really have much experience to give that last sentence any weight, but hey, first impressions matter.

Some of Umbrellapp's downsides:

- It's codebase is horribly disorganized. The main Dashboard component has 349 lines of code.
- I didn't put that much focus on what it would feel like to come back to this project after a year. The main goal was just to make the thing look cool and work.
- I was so focused on understanding how to use Material UI's components, that I didn't really pay attention to some pretty big UI flaws that were occurring on the front end.
- As a single page app, the API key was exposed for anyone to take and use as they please.

There's many more. Trust me. Yeah, the app looks light years better than the original, but only to my friends and family. If you actually look at the code from a developer's prespective, it's pretty hacky.

So, after having been exposed to NextJS from a Udemy tutorial, I decided that I would use their framework to rebuild my weather app. The intention now, would be that of refinement. All the major parts were there, all I needed to do was port everything over, right?

NextJS makes you think about building React apps in such a different way. First of all, it has page based routing, which was new to me. Apparently, this was what made PHP so alluring and nice to work with. Also, there's no complicated setup and right out of the box you get cool features like automatic code spitting for each route.

Some key points about the building of Weathernaut:

- All source code has been completely refactored to be modular, easy to read, well commented, and very maintainable.
- Dynamic page based routing with NextJS.
- Replaced the large useReducer hook with by wapping the entire up with a Redux wrapper.
- Implementation of serverless functions to protect API keys.
- Material-UI custom theming makes changing the look and feel of the app as simple as changing two variables.
- State will persist (per session) on page reload with redux-persist.
- Many small improvements with the UI/UX.

And of course, a gif for you:

## Getting Started

> **NOTE**
> The Darksky API was just acquired by Apple, so unfortunately, they are no longer accepting API signups for new API keys. On March 31st, 2020: _"Our API service for existing customers is not changing today, but we will no longer accept new signups. The API will continue to function through the end of 2021. As part of this transition, use of Dark Sky by Apple is subject to the Apple Privacy Policy, which can be found at apple.com/privacy."_

### Prerequisites

1. You'll need a MapBox API key. Sign up to get one [here](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/).
2. ~~You'll need a DarkSky API key~~ **No longer available.**

_A future update will replace the Darksky API with weatherstack.com, stay tuned.)_

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/stevendelro/Weathernaut.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```
yarn
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory (right next to your package.json) and add the following declarations:

```
MAPBOX_KEY=pk.eyJ1Ijoic3RldmVuZGVscmjlh3Q0In0c.EUeki9FFRcyDIirOGn26vw9zYXJpbyIsImEiOiJjanl2Zndp2lta2xyNbmwwb3p3M
DARKSKY_KEY=7601daeb3e11b6f49672afaebbb45cc1

// Note: These specific keys have been scrambled.
```

4. Build it:

```jsx
yarn build
```

5. Fire it up:

```jsx
yarn start
```

6. Head over to `localhost:3000` and see it in action.

## Usage

1. The app will ask for your permission to use your browser's geolocation coordinates. If you accept, it will automatically fetch your local weather data. If you deny, you will be presented with a search bar.
2. Search for weather.
3. Find out whether or not _(get it?)_ you'll need an umbrella.

## Roadmap

1. Due to DarkSky closing down it's API for open source usage, I will be updating the app to utilize weatherstack.com's API. Tentative date of completion is to be determined.

## Acknowledgements

> I wouldn't have been able to learn how to code without the courses and tutorials that more experienced developers have made. Talk down all you want about Udemy, but having someone tailor an experience as intimate as 20+ hour one-on-one session for just about ten bucks is just unbeatable.

## Advice

> QUESTION: Which of these resources you would recommend to someone with a basic grasp of the components but a tough time finishing my understanding?

### The Quick Answer (Starting with React):

_If you're more of a visual learner that loves explanations:_

I'd suggest this Stephen Grider course. He goes all out with diagrams in order to visualize concepts in order to mentally conceptualize what exactly is happening and why. His teaching style can be very long and drawn out, but it's extremely thorough. If you have a tough time fully understanding how all the parts work, Stephen Grider would be my suggested instructor for you.

_If you're a hands on type:_

I'd suggest Andrew Mead's React course. His teaching style is well paced and thoroughly thought out. The way he introduces new concepts and how he implements pauses for you to complete small challenges are extremely consistent, which helps for the student to pay attention on understanding the material, as opposed to having to figure out what exactly is happening.

_It might help to fully complete a course of your choosing, then build something similar to it on your own afterwards, while referencing the same course whenever you get stuck. Other than that, there's no shortcut. Just keep making things!_

### The Long Answer (Starting from zero):

- **Gain foundational knowledge**

I'd start with one of the long learning tracks on: https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks. Don't bother with the techdegree stuff, just get a basic account.

Begin learning HTML, CSS, and how to navigate the terminal. Move onto Javascript and get really familiar with strings, arrays, object and even ES6. A lot of problem solving comes with knowing how to manipulate arrays objects and strings.

- **Read other people's code. Explain code out loud.**

Along the way, start looking at other people's code. Preferably, someone who is around your level of understanding, or even just a bit higher. Learn how to talk about code with other. Learn how the data travels through the code and how it transforms as it goes through functions and conditionals.

- **Begin reading documentation**

It's super tough to read documentation when you first start out, which is why it's really important to start sooner. Documentation is the main human interface of any technology, so start reading and explaining how code works to yourself and to others. Embrace the weird jargon and complicated fancy words. It may seem silly but it's necessary to truly communicate what is happening to others at scale.

- **Expand beyond teamtreehouse, build projects**

When you feel comfortable with javascript and ES6 syntax, it's time to move through a legitimate React course. You should be able to parse through the Facebook documentation by this point, so that's always a great place to start, but if you are anything similar to me, you may prefer some tactile, explicit instruction.

Teamtreehouse has some great React content and it's always evolving. I racked up over a 1000 points in a single week on the teamtreehouse platform when I first started. It's a good place to interact with peers of similar ability. I was just under 10,000 points when I moved onto Udemy courses.

- **BUILD PROJECTS**

Before you fall into the tutorial black hole, start building projects on your own. I built a mortgage calculator, change calculator, budget tracker, multiple weather apps and a To Do app. While building these apps, I ran into problems and I used Udemy tutorials to help me understand and eventually resolve my problems. The trick is to make a project slightly similar to the tutorial project (slightly similar meaning: completely different features, but same overall idea) that way you aren't just copy and pasting code. Having different features means that you can't get all the answers from the tutorial.

- **Beginning tutorials**

Speaking of Udemy courses, be careful of what courses you choose to take. You will forever be influenced by your instructors. You are learning and can be easily influenced, so pick your influences carefully. I suggest, first and foremost, [Andrew Mead's](https://www.udemy.com/user/andrewmead/) courses. Complete all the challenges in each video and you will learn faster. He has great pacing and his teaching style is really dialed in and his lessons flow as if he planned them out for months before shooting.

If you are a visual learner and enjoy diagrams and long explanations, [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/) has a ton of content. Sometimes his style is too verbose and long winded for me, but it's undeniably thorough. He too, must have spent a ton of time preparing for each tutorial. I have many friends that really love [Maximilian Schwarzmuller's](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) style and teaching, but I never completed one of his courses. His style just wasn't my cup of tea, especially after finding Grider and Mead. A notable mention: [Tyler McGinnis](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/). I have referenced his tutorials many times, and would have dived into his material head first had I found him earlier.

[Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw/featured) is a great youtube channel with concise and extremely clear explanations of some beginner React topics.

I've heard good things about [Colt Steele's](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) work, but never personally took any of his React courses. His [data structures and algorithms course](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) is worth checking out though.

- **Intermediate Tutorials**

If you are a quick learner and find many of these tutorials way too long and boring, I suggest looking into [Reed Barger's](https://www.udemy.com/user/reed-barger/) content. Many of his courses are slightly outdated, but his teaching style and the code he writes is top notch. His pacing is ripping fast, but the value per minute of time you get from his courses is incredible. It's a good change of pace after taking 40+ hour tutorials. If you can keep up, it's worth taking the time to be influenced by his style.

[Thomas Weibenfalk](https://www.udemy.com/user/thomas-928/) has some incredible work. His content is geared towards those who are fairly intermediate, but his personality and teaching style make his courses really enjoyable.

- **Advanced tutorials**

By this point you should understand how important it is to be influenced by the best people out there. The very best people out there are found on [frontendmasters.com](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/). You have the biggest names in the industry teaching courses on there. They also have a bunch of learning tracks on there, but most of their courses are taught in a lecture style (think: one -> to many), which isn't as direct as the Udemy courses are (think: one -> to one). Nevertheless, once you can keep up with them, make it a habit to be influenced by them regularly.

Hope this helps! Good luck!

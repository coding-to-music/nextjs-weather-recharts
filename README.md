# Weathernaut - NextJS - A Server Side Rendered Weather App

## Why build this app?

This is the third and final iteration of my React weather dashboard. Although the UI/UX is very similar to v2.0, the entire app was rewritten to utilize [NextJS] (https://nextjs.org/) and all the greatness that comes with server side rendering.

* The UI was created with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* The charts are made with [Recharts](https://https://recharts.org/en-US/).
* The weather icons were created by [Lance Snider](https://codecanyon.net/user/dxc).

## What's different?

* All source code has been refactored to be modular, easy to read, and very maintainable.
* Implementation of serverless functions to protect API keys.
* Replaced the large useReducer with Redux.
* Dynamic page based routing.
* Material-UI custom theming makes changing the look and feel of the app as simple as changing two variables.
* Improved UI/UX.
